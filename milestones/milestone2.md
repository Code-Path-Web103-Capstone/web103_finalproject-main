## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We designed the wireframes, and also we used diagram.io to create our relationship diagram. We also started to think about the pitch presentation and what we will include in it.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Creating the wireframes was a bit challenging because we had to think about the user experience and how the user will interact with the app. We also had to think about the different pages and how they will be connected, especially the user input page and the connection with the Dashboard. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We are trying to make it automatic to get the information from pdf statements, so we will need to learn how to use AI or OCRs to parse the user's bank or credit statements effectively. We will also need to look into how to manage this sensitive information and keep our web app to the highest security and privacy standards. Besides this, we feel adequately skilled to finish this project.
