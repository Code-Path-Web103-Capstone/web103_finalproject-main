## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We creating a basic wireframe for our pages and also implemented all the crud operations for our database. We also created a project board and added all the issues to the board.


### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

How to create a good docs so we know what endpoints we are using and also how to use react on the frontend. We also had some issue with login and authentication.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We finished a lot of the thing that we had planned on the back end but we still need to add this functionalities on the front end.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The one to one relationship how can we use that case in our database because most of our logis is one to many. And also the many to many.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We need to know what counts as a finished product we we are implementing the features, beacuse maybe we can do some verbatim and it doens't have to be very especific.
