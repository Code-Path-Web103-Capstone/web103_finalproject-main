## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

In this unit, we found our project idea and began brainstorming how our web app would function; from user input to the general function of gobudget. We have a strong foundation so far from which we will test and narrow down our ideas into the base budgeting service and add features as we go. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The biggest challenge we have run into is the initial input the user must complete in order for our budgeting plan to be created. It is very tedious to input bank or credit statements manually and this is one feature we have been thinking about. Besides this, we have also been evaluating which user stories are the most important and will make the biggest impact when it comes to budget plans. This ties into also gaining a strong financial literacy to be able to suggest budgeting plans that are realistic and viable in order to keep our users on track. These are obstacles we are actively working on and have been researching. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

In the upcoming units, we will need to gain a strong knowledge of using AI or OCRs to parse the user's bank or credit statements effectively. We will also need to look into how to manage this sensitive information and keep our web app to the highest security and privacy standards. Besides this, we feel adequately skilled to finish this project.
