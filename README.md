## About

### Description and Purpose

Gobudget is an app that helps you manage your finances. It allows you to create budgets, track your expenses, and see your spending habits. The app is designed to be simple and easy to use so that you can focus on your finances without the hassle.

### Inspiration

Every month we get a bank statement or a credit statement, and we see how much we spent, but we don't really know where all that money went. We wanted to create an app that helps you track your expenses and see where your money is going. You can see how much comes in and goes through an intuitive interface that visualizes income, expenses, debt, savings, and more.
